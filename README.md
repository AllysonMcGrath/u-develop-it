# U-Develop-It Election Database- SQL, MySQL

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create the back-end for a database about an election. The database uses SQL to manage the data about candidates, parties, voters, and votes. This includes routes to retrieve stored data, such as the names of candidates, information on voters, and number of votes per candidate. Also included are routes to add candidates, voters, and votes. Voters and candidates can also be updated with put routes.

1. Clone the repo (see above instructions)
2. Run 'npm install' from the command line
3. Run 'npm run start' from the command line
4. Use an application such as Insomnia Core to test the routes as seen in the routes/apiRoutes files
